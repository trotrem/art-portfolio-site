ABOUT

Anny’s parents are dead. In an instant, she is alone, forced to face an impossible question that has shadowed her existence since she was a child. But the answer to this question will not be found 
above ground…

Far beneath the surface, there is another world, a secret world. A nocturnal society where magic is not dead, and where the fine line between fact and fairy tale is dangerously undefined.

Amidst inexplicable wonders and nightmarish monsters, Anny will discover the truth about her past. Far from the city and all that she knows, deep below ground in the Goblin Market.
